// what will be logged in first example and in second example?

let var1;
console.log(var1);
console.log(typeof var1); // type of undefined is undefined

let var2 = null;
console.log(var2);
console.log(typeof var2); // type of null is object

// undefined is a variable that is declared but the value is not assigned yet inside this variable.
// null is a variable that is defined but is missing a value.

// when we to use null, when to use undefined
// depends on your code styled and your team because you can use both of them in projects.
